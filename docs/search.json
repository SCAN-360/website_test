Social and physical environments, including access to healthcare, parks, and other health-promoting resources, play a major role in your health.\nThe Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center’s catchment, or service, area is South Florida, a region that spans over 10,000 square miles and is located within the Southeast “corner” of the Florida peninsula. Sylvester’s catchment area is made up of four counties: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Monroe.\nSouth Florida is a unique place. It features vibrant diversity that can’t be found anywhere else. South Florida is home to more than six million people, or approximately one-third of Florida’s entire population, and includes a mix of urban and rural counties. Nearly half of all people living in South Florida were born outside of the United States, and more than half speak a language other than English as their primary tongue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Haiti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida City\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHialeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiami Beach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany factors affect the health of neighborhood residents, and impact people’s ability to prevent, detect and treat diseases such as cancer.\nFactors Affecting Health in South Florida\nAge\n20% of adults are ages 65 and older – the largest population of individuals in this age group in the U.S.\nHousehold Income\nMedian household income is $48,431 (compared to $53,889 for the U.S.)\nPoverty\n14% of people live below the federal poverty line (compared to 11% for the U.S.)\nUnemployment\n11% of people in South Florida are unemployed (compared to 9% for the U.S.)\nUninsured\n24% of individuals don’t have health insurance (compared to 13% in the U.S.)\nSmoking\n21% of South Floridians smoke (compared to 15% in the U.S.)\nPhysical Activity\n27% of people report no leisure time for physical activity (compared to 23% in the U.S.)"

The rest of this section details the factors that are reported in SCAN 360, organized by data source."
